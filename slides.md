# Structure of the app

- Data fetching (as a side effect) when page is first rendered
- Defensive code to prevent behaviors, based on booleans: Open the form if a condition is met when clicking on *Add a todo* button
- Booleans need to be synced from multiple places (error prone)
- Sometimes, a behavior is so complex to implement that the reason behind it fades out
  - Conditionally calling a debounced version of `synchronizeTodoList`

<!--
Open VSCode with code for /without-xstate page

- Date fetching
- Prevent from opening the form during initial loading
- Need to

# It's time for a better world.

A world made of state machines.

---

# What are state machines?

- Finite number of *states*
- In exactly one state at a time
- An *initial* state
- Wait for *events*
- Events trigger *transitions* from one state to another one
- Transitions are *deterministic* (same sequence of events always gives the same result)

# State machine to fetch data

# At the end... what is XState?

- https://stately.ai/docs (ðŸ†• New documentation released last week!)
- Library to create state machines in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Can be used anywhere JavaScript can run (browser, Node.js, Temporal Workflows, ...)
- In the frontend, it can be used with any framework, and even with no framework at all
- [Stately](https://stately.ai) develops visual tools for XState

---

# Set up XState in the page

- `createMachine` to define a machine
- `useMachine` to interpret a machine and get it's current state
- `state.matches('...')` to know if the machine is in a particular state
- `send(...)` to send an event to the machine

---

# Reimplement with XState

- Logic is centralized in the machine
- Event handlers only forward events â€“ with a payload or not
- View *derives* state from the current state of the machine
- Context is used to store infinite data, like a list of todos

---

# Pros and cons of XState

<br>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2">
<div>

## Pros

- Application logic is centralized and kept apart from implementation details
- Application logic is easier to understand, and even more with visual tools
- The logic is predictable; only what has been defined in the machine can occur
- Non-developers can understand the code â€“ and even participate to it!

</div>

<div>

## Cons

- Learning curve with statecharts, and with XState API
- Not a paradigm wildly adopted in front-end development; might take some efforts to convert a team to it

</div>
</div>

---

# Other things XState can do

- Libraries for all front-end frameworks: @xstate/react, @xstate/vue, @xstate/svelte, @xstate/solid (coming soon)
- [@xstate/inspect](https://stately.ai/docs/tools/inspector): Inspect a machine in real-time and interact with it
- [@xstate/test](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate/packages/xstate-test): Generate tests from a state machine (aka. Model-Based Testing)
- [Power a CLI built with Node.js](https://github.com/mattpocock/matt-cli/blob/13953df17e05213bff1f69fb1e9e416a3996171a/src/pr.ts)
- [In a Node.js server](https://youtu.be/qqyQGEjWSAw)
- [Power a Temporal Workflow](https://github.com/Devessier/temporal-electronic-signature)
- Soon... with other languages than JavaScript
